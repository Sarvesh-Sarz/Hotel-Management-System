Hotel Management System (Python + SQL)
The Hotel Management System is a database-driven application developed using Python for the front-end logic and SQL for
secure data storage and management. The system is specifically designed to assist the hotel administrator in efficiently
managing daily operations and maintaining organized customer records.

This application provides a user-friendly administrative interface that enables the hotel management to:
  --Add, update, and delete customer details
  --Manage room availability and bookings
  --Monitor check-in and check-out records
  --Maintain billing and payment information
  --Store and retrieve customer history securely

All customer-related information, including personal details, reservation data, room allocation, and transaction records, 
is stored in a structured SQL database. The integration of Python with SQL ensures smooth data handling, efficient querying, and reliable storage.

The system aims to:
  --Improve operational efficiency
  --Reduce manual paperwork
  --Minimize human errors
  --Provide faster access to customer information
  --Ensure data integrity and security

By combining Python’s programming capabilities with SQL’s robust database management features, this project delivers a scalable, 
efficient, and practical solution for modern hotel administration.
